# Introduction

In recent years `Node` is a technology which has taken the world by storm. Many companies (including the one i work for) have transitioned away from the popularity of older server side technologies in order to coagulate the experience of their developers into a single point, where all devs are able to work on all parts of the project, giving smaller teams more hands on deck for larger problems which may occur. Of course, this is not the only reason. Yes, `Node` has enabled us to use `JavaScript` as a server side language, opening up the doors to back end development to the front end developers.

I started my own journey in `Node` quite recently, first using it in a professional capacity as of January this year (2022), you could say I am late to the party. This is because I initially began my role primarily as a `PHP` developer, working on a `RESTful API`, with some work on a `React` frontend. Having always had to goal in mind of becoming a generalist software engineer I enjoy learning concepts and feeling my way through the code of any language I turn to. `Node` has enabled this far more by allowing me to focus on `JavaScript`, a language which I had little experience with prior, in doing so this provides a good grounding for branching into concepts in other languages too, as having a goto language that allows me to experiment with both front and back end concepts is incredibly useful, and prevents the usual "brain overlap" we often get when jumping between multiple syntaxes on a single project. Personally, I have found `Node` to have a low barrier to entry, or in the words of [Nolan Bushnell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nolan_Bushnell) <em>"Easy to learn but hard to master"</em>, this makes `Node` an incredibly rewarding language, which has also helped me to understand much deeper (lower level) concepts by essentially moving the `JavaScript` runtime to run on the backend.

So what is the goal here? why do I write this? I write this not only as a guide for you dear reader, but for my own fundamental understanding, to paraphrase a quote from one of the greatest minds of the (recently) modern era <em>"If you can't explain it simply, you don't know it well enough"</em>. As such, I have made it my goal for each thing I learn to be able to explain it to my colleagues and peers, as and when it is needed, in the most simplistic manner possible to enable others to understand the concepts. As such, if you are reading this, you are my guinea pig, please, do hold me to account and call out any inconsistencies in these documents it will help my own learning as well as others. Remember, the best way to learn is to `understand` not to `imitate`, you need to know not only `how` to do something but `why` you are doing it, otherwise you can only use that knowledge in one specific context, thus, taken out of context, the knowledge becomes useless. So, without further ado, lets get into `Node`.
